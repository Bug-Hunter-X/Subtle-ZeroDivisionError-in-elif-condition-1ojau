# Subtle ZeroDivisionError in elif Condition

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Python due to an oversight in error handling within an `elif` condition.

The `bug.py` file contains a function (`function_with_uncommon_error`) with a flaw.  While it correctly handles the case where `a` is 0, it does not consider the possibility of `b` being 0 when evaluating the `elif b == 0` condition. This results in a `ZeroDivisionError` when `b` is 0, even if `a` is not 0.

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function, showcasing how to properly handle the potential for `b` to be 0 using a `try-except` block.

This example highlights the importance of meticulous error handling in all branches of conditional statements to prevent unexpected exceptions.
